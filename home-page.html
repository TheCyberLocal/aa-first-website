            My favorite quote - Song of the Realization of the Way:
        </h2>
        <p class="main-element">
            "When I began to study the Way, I saw mountains as mountains and waters as waters. When I arrived at a more intimate knowledge, I saw that mountains are not mountains and waters are not waters. But now that I have attained the very substance, I see mountains once again as mountains and waters once again as waters." - Chinese Zen master Qingyuan Xingsi of the 9th century Tang dynasty.
